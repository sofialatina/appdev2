## 1. What went well

### Activities, Lessons, or Projects I Felt Confident About
My group because I know that they have my back even if I am just me and even though I have many shortcomings. I still don't feel confident in myself but I am improving by each challenge that this world throws at me, so, I will continue to work for this group.

### Skills or Concepts I Have Mastered
The skill that I mastered is adaptability and a lil bit of working underpressure because of my role as the figma components maker. I also think that I have polished my skill in using figma more this year because of this project. As I have learned many new things in the ways that a component works and that I can find a loophole to make it work. In this subject I also learned perseverance because coding is not my strong suit.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges

### Topics or Tasks That Were Difficult
Tasks that was difficult for me is the deadline. I do meet the deadline but time management is my weakness and I am working on that. But it is still diffucult for me especially when I get sick, I can't seem to find the balance immediately and the pressure and the feeling that I am a burden which is I am. So... I apologize and I hope I can make "bawi sainyo and to myself". Every topic for me was a challenge because I don't really get the code immediately and even when I study alone I don't get some parts of it.

### Obstacles Encountered During Projects or Activities
I don't think learning while working on the project was a major obstacle because everyday you learn new things and gain new insights. So, for me I encountered things that I needed to learn to make it work and sometimes you just need to find a loophole to make the deadline. Major obstacle is the feeling of pressure na tipong pinapasa ko tong act/proj pero hindi ko padin gets yung ibang part which is I feel like I'm not doing enough because the teacher made an effort to teach but it does not sink in in my brain, and I feel sorry for myself and guilty kase ginawa ng teacher yung best nya magturo tas kakapirangot lang natutunan ko. So, I do double or triple the effort to understand it but sometimes I can't do that.

## 3. Key Learnings

### Technical and Conceptual Takeaways
This might be funny but for me micro and macro commit is what I will answer in this part. That is because saving your work, may it be small or large is a progress you and others see. It is the part where your effort is being documented and being recorded like winning an award or certificate because it is being acknowledge.  

### Technical and Soft Skills
- **Technical Skills:**  
Is that I learned a new language which is Javascript.

- **Soft Skills:**  
Time management, understanding, patience, and respect is essential to work with others as a group.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

### Skills or Concepts to Focus On
I want to improve my understanding on how and why this part of the code is needed. I also want to strengthen my skills in figma and improve my designs. 

### Improving Contribution in Team Projects
I can contribute more in the team if I improve my time management and not get sick (so I need to improve my health).

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

### Goals for the Course
Goal is to improve my understanding of making components in figma so that I can reduce the time in making the Ui/Ux so that I can shoulder some of the other tasks that are within my capabilities for the team.

### Support or Guidance Needed
Camaraderie, instructions and hints, teachers guidance, advice and patience, but most importantly God's guidance.
